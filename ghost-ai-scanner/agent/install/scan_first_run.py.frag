# FRAGMENT: scan_first_run.py.frag
# PROJECT: PatronAI — Phase 1A
# VERSION: 1.0.0
# UPDATED: 2026-04-26
# OWNER: Giggso Inc (Ravi Venugopal)
# PURPOSE: First-run flag handler. setup_agent.sh creates
#          ~/.patronai/first_run.flag at install time. Phase 1A
#          scanners read IS_FIRST_RUN; if True, they widen their search
#          (e.g. tool/regex matching is less strict, vector-db hunt
#          covers all discovered repos rather than top-matches only).
#          The footer clears the flag after a successful payload print
#          so subsequent recurring scans run in the lighter, fast mode.
# AUDIT LOG:
#   v1.0.0  2026-04-26  Initial. Phase 1A.
