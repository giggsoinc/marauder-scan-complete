# FILE: src/ingestor/pipeline.py
# VERSION: 2.0.0
# UPDATED: 2026-04-26
# OWNER: Ravi Venugopal, Giggso Inc
# PURPOSE: Per-event processing pipeline. Takes raw event dict,
#          normalises to flat schema, matches against provider lists,
#          writes finding to store. Identity resolution and alerting
#          handled downstream by alerter.py.
# AUDIT LOG:
#   v1.0.0  2026-04-18  Initial.
#   v2.0.0  2026-04-26  ENDPOINT_SCAN no longer dropped at the dst-domain
#                       check. New _process_endpoint_scan() explodes each
#                       finding into one flat event. Clean scans drop entirely
#                       (heartbeat covers liveness). Pre-classified events
#                       skip the matcher (agent already filtered them).
#   v2.1.0  2026-04-26  Phase 1A. After writing each `mcp_server` finding,
#                       compare its config_sha256 to the last known hash
#                       for (device, mcp_host). On flip, emit a derived
#                       `mcp_config_changed` event with severity HIGH so
#                       the alerter pages someone when MCP config changes.
# DEPENDS: normalizer, matcher, blob_index_store
