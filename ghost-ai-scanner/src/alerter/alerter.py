# OWNER: Ravi Venugopal, Giggso Inc
# PURPOSE: Main alerter coordinator. Reads fresh findings from store,
#          checks dedup, resolves identity, enriches with CloudTrail
#          spot check, builds payload, dispatches to all channels.
#          Called by main.py after each ingestor cycle completes.
# DEPENDS: alerter.payload, alerter.dispatcher, alerter.cloudtrail_check
